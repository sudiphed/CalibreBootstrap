CalibreBootstrap
================

Bootstrap template for the Calibre Content Server

Demo
================
http://tranquilbase.org:9111

Install
==============
Linux
```
Copy the contents into ~/.config/calibre/resources/content_server
```
Windows
```
Copy the contents into [install_path]\resources\content_server
```

Note
==============
A lot of the markup is outside of my control (generated within the Calibre python binary) and it's either not possible or too much work to alter it.  Bootstrap3
 cannot be fully taken advantage of because of that.
